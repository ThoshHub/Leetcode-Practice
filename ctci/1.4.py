# Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palin
# drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
# is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.


# strip all spaces
# then build dictionary for each letter in input string
# key = letter
# value = number of times that letter shows up in the string
# all values must be divisible by two except one
